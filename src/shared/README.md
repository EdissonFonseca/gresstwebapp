# Shared

Reusable components, utilities, types, and constants. **No business logic** — presentational UI and pure helpers only.

- **components/** — Buttons, inputs, cards, layout (presentational)
- **utils/** — Pure utility functions
- **types/** — Shared TypeScript types
- **constants/** — App-wide constants
