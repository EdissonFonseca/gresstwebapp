# Commit message format

When generating or suggesting commit messages (including for "dame el texto para el commit" or similar requests), **always** use this format:

1. **Subject (first line)**
   - One line, imperative mood, ~50 characters or less.
   - No period at the end.
   - Examples: `Add profile API integration`, `Fix CORS with dev proxy`, `Disable mock when proxy is used`.

2. **Body (optional but recommended)**
   - One blank line after the subject.
   - Wrap at ~72 characters. Explain what and why, not how.
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes when helpful.

3. **Output for the user**
   - Provide both a **short** version (subject only, for `git commit -m "..."`) and a **full** version (subject + body) for `git commit` without `-m` (so the editor opens and they can paste the full message).

**Example full message:**

```
Integrate profile API and fix local QA testing

- Profile: real endpoint GET /api/me/profile, show only name and email
- Dev: VITE_DEV_BEARER_TOKEN and proxy (VITE_PROXY_API_TARGET) for CORS
- Disable mock when proxy is used so real API is called
- Docs and .env.example updated
```

**Example short (subject only):**  
`Integrate profile API, dev proxy for CORS, and Bearer token for QA testing`

When the user asks only for "el texto para el commit" or "commit message", offer both the one-line subject and the full subject+body so they can choose.
